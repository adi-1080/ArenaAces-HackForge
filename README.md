PS:
Generally budding or aspiring authors have doubts or certain complications
reagrding their plot/ storyline. An AI assistant that could help in making
coherent and engrossing storylines and also help authors fix problems/
blocks in their plots could help. Also, it could act as a storywriter by writing
a chapter or a piece of a chapter. The model should be able to interpret the
target audience age of the novel/story/novella, generate the chapters
accordingly using the audience-tailored vocabulary, should not generate
gibberish and must be high quality descriptive storywriting by adhering to
modern and loved writing practices by referring to some of the bestsellers
across all genres.
Core Functionalities:
1. Audience-Aware Chapter Generation
Accept user inputs like story genre, age group of readers, plot outline,
and character details.
Use LLMs to generate high-quality story content with vocabulary and
tone appropriate for the specified audience (e.g., children, young adults,
adults).
2. Narrative Coherence & Plot Block Assistance
Detect plot holes, inconsistencies, or pacing issues. Suggest changes
and/or review current plots from authors.
Suggest alternate plot directions, character arcs, or climaxes.
Bonus: Use embeddings or memory tools to track long-term plot context.
3. Creative Expansion & Branching
Offer multi-branching story path suggestions (e.g.,
"What if the villain
betrays the hero?")
Allow writers to explore different outcomes in a “choose-your-ownadventure” format.
